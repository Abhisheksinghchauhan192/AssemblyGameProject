## 🎮 Game Concept

In this game, a **random word** is selected, and the player must **guess the word one letter at a time**. But there’s a twist!

- You start with **multiple assembly languages** (like x86, ARM, MIPS, etc.).
- Every time you guess a **wrong letter**, you **lose one assembly language**.
- If you lose your **last assembly**, it's **Game Over**.
- If you guess the word correctly, you're rewarded with **confetti and victory**!
- Option to **restart the game** after winning or losing.
